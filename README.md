###### (Georgia Institute of Technology Course Critique)


This is a modified fork of the official repository for Georgia Tech's Course Critique application. To host your own Course Critique you can follow the parent project's instructions.
To utilize the additions, two new tables need to be created. Each table holds all of the humanities or social science classes respectively.
A CSV of each collection of classes can be found under /csv
